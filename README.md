This project was created on Glitch, and bootstrapped with Create React App.
Bill Moriarty created this implementation for a course at Temple University.

The best way to play with this code is to go here to Glitch and click "remix this" https://glitch.com/~philly-311-react
Glitch takes care of running a Node app online while you edit it.

This is a site that contacts Open Data Philly's 311 dataset and displays charts using react.js.
